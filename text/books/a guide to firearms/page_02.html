Be sure to read this book fully and thoroughly if you wish to get the most out of using firearms.</p>

<h2>Selecting a Gun</h2>
<p>There are quite a lot of guns to choose from, with each having their own pros and cons in different combat scenarios. While some may tell you otherwise, there is no one gun that can solve every situation you come across!</p>

<p><b>Pistols</b> are compact, generally cheap, easy to handle, and accurate. They're a perfect weapon to get into for those looking to get into ranged self defence, as they can be used by people by all skill levels. Only one hand is required to use a pistol, and if you're a skilled user, you can even use two pistols at once for double the firepower!</p>

<p><b>Revolvers</b>, like pistols, are generally cheap, and easy to handle, but generally high amounts of damage compared to regular pistols at the cost of a reduced firerate and reduced magazine size. They're for the more skilled and careful shooter, but all can be fired using only one hand. Most models are a little more difficult to reload if you do not have access to a speedloader.</p>

<p><b>SMGs</b> are relatively compact, fast firing, and excellent for medium range combat. They use a small calibre, but they fire significantly faster and have greater magazine sizes. An SMG is an excellent choice if you're willing to spend more on ammo for more bullets downrage.</p>

<p><b>Shotguns</b> are bulky, slow firing, but have extremely high stopping power at close range. Shotguns generally require two hands to hold, and are more difficult to reload as most shotguns are not magazine fed. Shotguns have a lot of speciality ammo to make them extremely versatile to an expert.<p>

<h2>Reloading</h2>
<p>Reloading is an easy process if you know what you're doing.</p>


<p><b>Bullet-fed guns</b> are guns that have an internal way of holding bullets and don't require any external mechanisms. In order to load a bullet fed gun, you must have the bullets itself in hand and insert them into the weapon. Some weapons, like revolvers, have objects called <b>speedloaders</b> that allow you to insert multiple bullets into the gun at once.</p>

<p><b>Magazines-fed guns</b> are guns which require bulky square containers for bullets. In order to load a magazine fed gun, you must insert bullets into an empty magazine, then insert the filled magazine into a gun, then cock the slider if there isn't already a bullet in the chamber. For most guns, you can tell whether or not there is a bullet in the chamber by examining the slider position. If a slider is all the way back, then the gun is unloaded. If the slider is all the way forward, then it is not loaded. To unload the magazine fed gun, simply eject the magazine with your other hand. It is possible to do a <b>speed reload</b> by using another magazine on the gun to replace the already existing magazine, however the old magazine will drop to the ground in the process.</p>
